# CS-210-Portfolio-SNHU-Craw

Welcome to my CS 210 portfolio! This repository contains my coursework and projects from the CS 210 C++ Programming class.

## About This Course
CS 210 focuses on mastering C++ programming fundamentals, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and exception handling. Throughout the course, I have completed various programming assignments, labs, and projects to build my skills in C++ development.

## Repository Contents
- **C++ Programming Assignments:** Includes exercises on exception handling, linked lists, class design, and other core C++ concepts.
- **Lab Activities:** Hands-on coding labs that reinforce programming techniques and problem-solving strategies.
- **Projects:** More complex programs demonstrating use of C++ features and best practices.

## Reflection
1. Project Summary

This project focused on solving the problem of tracking and analyzing grocery store purchases. It reads a list of items from a file, counts how many times each item appears, and helps the user quickly find information about item frequencies. It’s a small but useful tool that automates what would otherwise be a time-consuming process.

2. What I Did Well

I think I did a good job organizing the code and making it easy to follow. Using a class to hold all of the main logic kept the program structured, and using a map was a smart choice for managing the data efficiently. I’m also proud of the readability of my code and the effort I put into adding comments that explain what each part does.

3. Where I Could Improve

If I were to improve this program, I would focus on making it more flexible for users. For example, I could make item searches ignore capitalization and handle unexpected file errors in a smoother way. These changes would make the program feel more polished and professional. I could also add more input validation to make the program even more secure and reliable.

4. Challenges and How I Overcame Them

The most challenging part for me was working with file input and output. At first, I struggled with making sure the program opened and closed files correctly and didn’t lose data. To fix that, I reviewed examples from the textbook, looked at online C++ documentation, and did a lot of testing with smaller files until I was confident everything worked the way it should.

5. Transferable Skills

This project helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and apply concepts from object-oriented programming in a real-world scenario. I also learned a lot about debugging and thinking through how users will interact with a program. These are skills that I can apply to almost any programming project, regardless of the language.

6. Code Maintainability and Readability

I focused on writing clean, organized code that someone else could read and understand without too much explanation. I used consistent formatting, clear variable names, and helpful comments. By keeping the logic in one class and separating tasks into different functions, I made it easy to maintain or expand the program later on.
